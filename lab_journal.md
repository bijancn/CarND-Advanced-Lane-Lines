Half of the image is not really usable because we lose resolution at the
far end. I think it will get better when I take less of the frame for
the perspective transform

I want more of the good portion of the frame (the lower one) to count
for the fit

But maybe look at it after transforming back first

*Correction*: I had to make the destination rectangle simply bigger!
